The Co-working Space Booking System is a web application designed to manage and book desks in a co-working space. It allows users to book individual or team desks for a specified time period, apply discounts for longer bookings, and tracks revenue generated from bookings.

Features

Membership Tiers: For individual desks, there are three membership tiers: Basic, Premium, and Executive, each with different hourly rates.
Dynamic Pricing: Pricing is calculated based on membership tier and hours booked, with a 10% discount for bookings over 3 hours.
Desk Availability: Desks are marked as booked once reserved, preventing double bookings.
